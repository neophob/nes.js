/*

The APU (Audio Processing Unit)
The APU supported two square wave channels, a triangle wave channel, a noise channel and a delta modulation channel.
To play sounds, the game program would write to specific registers (addresses in memory) to configure these channels.
The square wave channels supported frequency and duration control, frequency sweeps and volume envelopes.
